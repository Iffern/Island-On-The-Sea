# Island On The Sea

In the project the island on the sea was model. On the island one can see the animals and plants (models imported from Sketchfab). You can move over the scene using arrows and mouse.

If you want to launch the project, copy the repository and open Island_on_the_sea.html in the browser (it can take a while to launch due to large amount of objects).
